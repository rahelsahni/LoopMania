## Agenda

2. Plan the refactoring of existing code/left over work from milestone 2
3. Assign tasks

## Minutes
### Milestone 3 Spec
Summary:
- Adjust user stories and UAC to reflect updates
- Adjust UML to reflect updates and milestone 2 feedback
- Update backend to reflect updates and finish left over milestone 2 work
- Update frontend to reflect updates and finish left over milestone 2 work
- Extend project with our own ideas

1. Backend (30%)
    - Implement new client requirements and own extension ideas
    - Breadth and depth required for extensions -> be creative
    - "extensions that are technically complex, but do not provide the user with any real benefit will be rewarded less than simpler extensions which maximise the user's experience" -> focus of UX
    - Update assumptions accordingly
2. Frontend (20%)
    - Greater emphasis on UX in this milestone -> therefore needs to be polished
    - Quality UX > quantity extensions
    - Extensions need to enhance UX -> pretend like we are trying to sell a product
3. UML Diagram (20%)
    - Needs to reflect new client requirements and own extensions
    - 4 design patterns (i.e. 1 extra from milestone 2)
    - Refactor milestone 2 code to be more OOP -> reflect this in UML
4. Testing (15%)
    - 90% backend coverage
    - Good test design and clarity
5. Project Management (15%)
    - User stories
        - Add new stories for updates and extensions
        - Add UAC to existing stories based on updates and extensions
    - Git practices
    - Timeline
    - Minutes

### Milestone 2 Leftover Tasks
- Each team member will:
    1. Finish leftover story cards/UAC assigned to them on task board
    2. Refactor the code they worked on in milestone 2 to be more OOP (i.e. encapsulation, design pattern)
- The deadline for this is Sunday 25th July

## Actionables
- Complete milestone 2 leftovers
- Think about possible extensions, considering all the advice given in the spec
- Next meeting on Sunday
