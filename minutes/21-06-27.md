### Milestone 1 Summary
1. Requirements Analysis (30%)
    - Produce epic stories from problem statement
        - Each epic has its own issue and a label (to mark user stories that fall under it)
    - Produce user stories that fall under epic stories
        - Place these on issue cards in Gitlab task board
        - User story is the issue name/title
        - The following go in the description:
            - Estimate for the implementation of the story in user story points
            - A label indicating epic story, and a label indicating priority
            - Acceptance criteria as a checklist (can be yes/no or given-when-then)
        - As progress is made, tick criteria off and move from To-Do -> Doing -> Closed
2. UML class diagram (20%)
    - Does not need to include any fields or methods in this Milestone
    - Only needs aggregation/composition/inheritance relationships and cardinalites
    - Place in a file called "design.pdf"
3. Low-fidelity UI design (20%)
    - Rough design of frontend and how user will interact with the application
    - Sketches/wireframes will suffice
    - Aim to be aesthetic, simple and accessible
    - Put in "frontend.pdf"
4. Project Management (20%)
    - Timeline planning
        - Use user stories and story points to create a timeline
        - For each week, create a list of objectives and assignees
        - Tasks only need to be broken down at the feature level
        - Consider frontend and backend work
        - Timespan of tasks reflect allocated story points
        - Put in "planning.pdf"
    - Meeting minutes
        - Summary of what was discussed and actionables
        - Evidence of version history
5. Assumptions (10%)
    - Assumptions associated with the team's unique design decisions
    - i.e. order of fighting, etc.
    - Put in "assumptions.md"
