### Milestone 1 Demo and Feedback
- 62/65
- Main thing is to fix UML diagram arrow between Entity and LoopManiaWorld

### Milestone 2 Update
- Everyone is still working through tests and basic implementations, trying to understand starter code
- Difficult because it is such a huge code base, and user stories overlap a little bit
- Is ok to implement stubs where needed, then fill it in later during merges

## Actionables
- Adjust UML based on milestone 1 feedback, as above
- Add attributes and methods to classes in UML
- Keep smashing through tests and begin implementations, ticking off UAT as we go
- Aim to integrate everything Sunday night!
