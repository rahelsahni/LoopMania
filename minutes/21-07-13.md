# Week 7 Minutes - 13/07/21

## Attendees
- Josh
- Mitchell
- Ben
- Rahel

## Agenda
1. UML review
2. Allocating user stories
3. Test driven development

## Minutes
### UML Review
- Feedback is yet to be received
- Ben will add basic constructors/getters/setters
- We will stick with current UML until we begin implementing, and update as we go since it is difficult at this stage

### Task Allocation
- Stick with task allocation from planning.pdf
- Discussion of procedure for completing user story cards

### Test Driven Development
- Write tests first. This includes JUnit tests and integration tests
- Implement relevant functions to complete a feature
- Run tests and modify accordingly to pass them
- Features completed in individual branches (membername/featurename)
- Merge features if they are reliant on others
- Pass all tests and submit merge request to master
- How to write tests:
    - Create an instance of the world with LoopManiaWorld
    - Create all necessary objects to test feature (i.e. vampire buildings to spawn vampires)
    - Basically create game scenarios in code and make sure it matches expected output
    - Use seeds for random behaviours, as well as property-based tests

## Actionables
- Have all tests done for assigned user stories by Thursday, as well as basic implementation
- After Thursday we will have feedback for UML -> adjust after the tute!
